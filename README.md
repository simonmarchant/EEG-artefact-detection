# A machine learning artefact detection method for single-channel infant event-related potential studies

This repository contains the code behind the methods and analysis for the paper "A machine learning artefact detection method for single-channel infant event-related potential studies" (Marchant et al. 2024).

Analysis is included in `analysis.ipynb`. Scripts for feature calculation, figures, and model optimisation are held in the appropriate subdirectories. To protect the privacy of research participants and colleagues, the underlying data is not included here. However, `example_data.csv` is a dummy dataset with the same structure as the dataset used to train the classifier. It contains a single row of dummy data, in order to better show the type of variables used.
